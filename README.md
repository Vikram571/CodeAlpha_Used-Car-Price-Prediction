# CodeAlpha_Used-Car-Price-Prediction

## 📌 Project Description

The **Used Car Price Prediction** project is a machine learning–based application designed to estimate the **selling price of used cars** based on important vehicle attributes. The system analyzes historical car data and predicts prices using features such as manufacturing year, present market price, kilometers driven, number of previous owners, fuel type, selling type, and transmission.

The model helps users make informed decisions while buying or selling used cars by providing a fair price estimate. It can be used by individual buyers, car dealers, and online automobile platforms.
